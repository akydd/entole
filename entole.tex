\begin{abstract}
Using TensorFlow, a popular tool for machine learning, we train a deep neural
network to categorize the various meanings of the Koine Greek word \textit{entole},
        and it's various forms,
when enough context is provided, and to predict the intended meaning of the same
word when there is not enough context present to determine its precise meaning.

\section{Introduction}
The word \textit{entole}, and it's variants, appear 67 times in the Greek New 
Testament. It is frequently, but not always, translated as
``commandment''. The type of commandment being referred to varies from text to 
text.

At times the meaning of ``commandment'' is clear from the context in which
the word appears.  For example, TODO.  However, there are times when the precise
meaning is not clear.  For example, TODO.
